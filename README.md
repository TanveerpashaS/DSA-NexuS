## About This Project

DSANexus was built as a hands-on project to understand the fundamentals of building a full-stack application from scratch. The goal was not just to create a chatbot, but to learn how to securely interact with powerful third-party APIs, engineer a unique personality for an AI model, and deploy a modern web application.

This app is built with only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** on the frontend, and a simple Node.js serverless function on the backend, demonstrating that powerful applications don't always require heavy frameworks.

##  How It Differs from ChatGPT/Gemini

This project was an exercise in creating a **specialized AI** rather than a general one.

| Feature | DSANexus | General AIs (ChatGPT, etc.) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | 🧠 Strictly focused on Data Structures & Algorithms. | 🌍 Can answer questions on any topic. |
| **Teaching Style** | 📖 Uses a custom, **analogy-first** method to explain complex topics in a simple, relatable way. | 🧑‍🏫 Provide standard, often technical-first explanations. |
| **Personality** | ⚙️ Has a unique, **no-nonsense, task-oriented** personality for any off-topic questions, forcing the user to stay focused. | 😊 Have a generic, universally helpful, and friendly personality. |
